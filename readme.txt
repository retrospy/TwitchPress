= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Contributors ==
List of developers and people who have supported development in a technical way... 

* nookyyy      - A popular Twitch.tv streamer who done half of the testing.
* IBurn36360   - Author of the main Twitch API class on GitHub.
* Automattic   - The plugins initial design is massively based on their work.  
* Ashley Rich  - I used a great class by Ashley (Username A5shleyRich).

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
